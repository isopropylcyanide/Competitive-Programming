#### What is it?

A collection of some programs under competetive programming competitions like `Hackerrank`, `CodeChef`, `SpoJ`
and `Leetcode` etc.

---

#### Your code has poor documentation

This repository has working programs that were submitted during competitions as it is. As such they lack comments and
proper documentation. However, you can use it as follows.

- Say, you want to look for sieve of eratosthenes's code snippet. Just search in the repo.
- If you want the implementation of the range min-max segment tree, just search segment-tree
- File names usually correspond to the problem title they refer to. So you can search by that.
- Solutions are grouped by languages.

---

#### Who is this for

- Budding programmers delving into the world of competitive programming wanting to see the code in action.
- Myself, to keep on solving problems at all stages of my life.

#### Why is it even here

I like to share and showcase all facets of my professional career. Competitive programming is something I extensively
did during my college days and I still give it a try whenever time permits.

As such this is a subtle reminder of my capabilites. I'd encourage others to do the same. The check box is motivation
enough :)
